# Speech Recognition Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **speech recognition** using **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**. The goal is to process audio data and train a model to recognize speech patterns efficiently.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy` - Numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` - Data visualization
  - `wave` - Audio file handling
  - `multiprocessing` - Parallel processing
  - `hmmfunc` - Hidden Markov Model implementation
  - `MonoPhoneHMM` - Monophone-based HMM

## ⚙️ Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib hmmfunc
```
